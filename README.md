Description: In this project, I made an educational game with regard to language learning, making use of the python speech recognition module, nltk (natural language processing toolkit) and tkinter.

### The functions of this game:

* There will two parts of the game: 1) Speaking 2) Sorting

* Speaking: there will be bubbles falling from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen, each bubble will contain an English word inside it.
   The learner needs to speak out the word in the bubble to make them disappear and get points.

* Sorting: The learner sort the word in the correct grammatical order, to gain points. They will gain 5 points for the easy level, and 10 points for the level 2 which is harder and involve propositional phrases.



### How to run the project:

To run the project, you just need to run the main.py file. Clicking the button in the game should take you to different modes.   

The libraries I am using that may need to be installed are all at the beginning of the python file, they include:   

Libraries: speech r ecognition, nltk, Modules : tkinter, numpy, random, PIL, playsound
